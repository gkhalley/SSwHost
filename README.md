# Introduction
This power strip makes your generator as efficient as possible. Each outlet is a load. The user sets priorities to loads using their phone. The smart power strip tries to maintain the user's priorities by turning on and off each outlet.

# Getting Started
This is a lengthy process. There are many steps to a novice, and you must not miss anything:
1.	Installation process
    - This requires two separate projects: Netduino and Phone. [VS2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/older-downloads/) is used for the Netduino because the .NET Micro Framework tools can be used. VS2017 is used for the Phone project because the Xamarin emulation tools are much easier to set up.
    - If you're new in Netduino development, I suggest you go to the [Getting started with Netduino](http://developer.wildernesslabs.co/Netduino/About/Downloads/) project to properly set up your development environment. 
2.	Software dependencies
You will also need to install:
    - .Net MicroFramework (.NETMF) v4.3.2
    - Netduino SDK 
3.	Latest releases
    - 0.1 has the initial
4.	API references
